      These things are not mentioned either to excuse the policy of the African states by their example,<br>
  or to censure those who have done them; but in order to obviate a vulgar reflection upon the African<br> 
  traders, which is, that the slavery of the people on that continent is owing to the demand their princes<br>
  have found for slaves from the American Colonies; whereas men have sold one another from the very earliest<br>
  ages of the world, and wherever sovereign authority has been lodged, it has assumed a right to dispose<br>
  of the lives and properties of the subjects. From the coast of Guinea to the extremity of Abyssinia there<br>
  is not a state, the Fantees only excepted, where the people are not, and as far as we know of them, <br>
  always were, slaves; and their princes and great men traded with one another in slaves long before America<br>
  was discovered. The demand which the American colonies have occasioned, has probably given rife to many<br>
  acts of tyranny and oppression in the sovereigns, in order to posses themselves of the slaves of their <br>
  great men; but on the other hand it may have made them more careful of the lives of their own slaves or <br>
  subjects, because of the profit they made by felling them. A captain of an English ship who had offered <br>
  the king of Dormi or Dehouma less than he had asked for five hundred of his slaves, was invited by him <br>
  to dinner the following day; they dined in a tent, and when they were rising from table, the king of Dormi <br>
  said to the captain,<br>
  <br>
  You would not give me my price for my five hundred slaves, did you think I valued them too high? You may <br>
  now have them for half the money. <br>
  <br>
  And ordering the back of the tent to be drawn up, the five hundred heads were shewn to him piled upon one <br>
  another. This story, which is indubitably attested, is a shocking proof of the despotism of the African <br>
  princes, and it also serves to show how ill founded another vulgar notion is, that the Negroes annually <br>
  brought to our colonies from Africa, are stolen by our traders from thence. Indeed it is astonishing, that <br>
  such a notion should ever have been entertained by any one, who ever thought about trade. To suppose that <br>
  the several European states should settle forts and factories upon that coast, in order to protect their <br>
  subjects in stealing away the inhabitants; that the same ships and captains should return annually to the <br>
  same places, and among them steal away near forty thousand people each voyage, is so monstrous, that the bare <br>
  stating it is a sufficient confutation. The manner in which that trade is carried on is this: <br><br>
  
  The return of our ships to the coast of Africa being regular, the Negroe factors bring down the slaves they<br>
  have purchased in the interior parts of the country at the times the ships are expected, and fell or barter<br>
  them to our captains for the best price they can get; some of these factors bring slaves even from the <br>
  interior parts of Abyssinia, if their own accounts may be credited, and others are brought them from an equal<br>
  distance to the sea coast of Barbary to supply the Turks. The princes and great men who reside near the coast,<br>
  or upon the navigable rivers, make their own bargains with our ship captains, or the governors of our forts, <br>
  so that instances are very rare, of even sngle Negroes being clandestinely carried off by any of our people; <br>
  whenever such a thing has been done, the captain who did it has never dared return there again; and very fatal <br>
  revenge has been taken upon some of his countrymen.
